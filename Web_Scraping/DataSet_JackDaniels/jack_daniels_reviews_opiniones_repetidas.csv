"Great product, tastes great, nice and smooth, but I think I spilled some and slipped cleaning it up. I woke up in my neighbors toy hauler covered in Vaseline and don’t remember a thing?????",2
Probably the best price around for this American classic. If you don’t have Jack Daniels in your home bar then your home bar is not complete.,2
Delivery professional and on time.,2
Great sour mash. Good on a budget too.,2
"It is very good, but I think I like the honey one more.",2
It’s jack 🤷🏼‍♀️ What can I say,2
You know what it is. You will love it or hate it. Or hate yourself the next morning. Got it for a great price during the holidays.,2
What's there to say except I got my JD delivered and didn't have to put on clothes to go out and get it!,2
