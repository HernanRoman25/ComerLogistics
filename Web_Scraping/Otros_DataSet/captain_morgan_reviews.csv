"Hey now ! Captain Morgan needs its props when do. Winter months we drink this with hot apple cider add in a small dollop of butter, mix it up, great hot toddy. Spiced rum is awesome spiced rum is great."
Try this with some cherry or Vanilla Coke and you will never drink water again. Love the captain smooth rum best rum on the market by far.
Very good.. Vanilla and spice perfect to add a hot tea in cold weather..
