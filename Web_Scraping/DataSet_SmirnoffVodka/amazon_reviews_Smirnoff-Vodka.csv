Review
"Always have some on hand to add to recipes, cocktails or to use in various crafts like cake decorating (It dries quickly with no smell)."
"I call this my yoga water. Mix it with a little 0 cal tangerine lime soda water and you might wanna be careful because you could end up being an alcoholic itâ€™s so delicious. Drink responsibly people, donâ€™t spill, Thatâ€™s called a party foul. I could be a spokes person for Smirnoff I love it that much."
"It's good. This is how vodka has always tasted. But there's not much of a distinction from other brands I've tried but still getting me a good buzz. No complaints. I recommend. Would buy again. In fact, placing another order right now along with some other ones.

"Butt at least I kissed her! Obviously Iâ€™m writing this after I drank the whole bottle. So uh..,.,,!â€™"
Good vodka

"IMHO, of course, after sampling dozes of brands, Smirnoff is the cleanest and smoothest, and mixes well with just about anything (other than whiskey), especially fruit juices, hard lemonade, spritzers and all the usual classic drinks like Pina Colada's and Electric Iced Tea, among your favorites as well. Absolutely recommended."
Vodka!!!
Just love these Amazon pickers and drivers..well worth the extra...please tip your delivery in cash if you can
"I love to drink after work it takes all the pain away and helps me sleep...

Viene bien protegido la botella en un empaque lleno de aire. No viene en caja lo q se me hace rato tal vez por la protecciÃ³n q le dan a la botella con el paquete.
