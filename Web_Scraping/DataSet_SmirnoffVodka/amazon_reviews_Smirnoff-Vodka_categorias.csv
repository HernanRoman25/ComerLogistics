"I call this my yoga water. Mix it with a little 0 cal tangerine lime soda water and you might wanna be careful because you could end up being an alcoholic itâ€™s so delicious. Drink responsibly people, donâ€™t spill, Thatâ€™s called a party foul. I could be a spokes person for Smirnoff I love it that much.",Otros
"It's good. This is how vodka has always tasted. But there's not much of a distinction from other brands I've tried but still getting me a good buzz. No complaints. I recommend. Would buy again. In fact, placing another order right now along with some other ones.

"IMHO, of course, after sampling dozes of brands, Smirnoff is the cleanest and smoothest, and mixes well with just about anything (other than whiskey), especially fruit juices, hard lemonade, spritzers and all the usual classic drinks like Pina Colada's and Electric Iced Tea, among your favorites as well. Absolutely recommended.",Experiencia General
